OVERVIEW
========

This project is a digital lock. As the user inputs characters using the keypad,
LEDs will be lit. After four keys are pressed, all LEDs will be lit if the code
was correct. Otherwise, all LEDs will be turned off.


COMPILING
=========

To build this project, simply run the Make utility.

$ make


INSTALLING
==========

To install the code to the ATMega32, we once again use Make.

$ make install


HARDWARE
========

Attach PORTA to SWITCHES, PORTB to LEDS, and PORTD to the keypad.


RUNNING
=======

The program will begin running automatically after running 'make install'. To
restart the program, hit the RESET switch on the development board.


SIZE
====

As part of this assignment, we were asked to determine the size in bytes of
each function used in this project. This data is most easily presented in a
table.

+-------------+------+
| FUNCTION    | SIZE |
+-------------+------+
| init        |   24 |
| keyInit     |  104 |
| io_in       |  142 |
| io_out      |  152 |
| main        |  286 |
| getKey      |  288 |
+-------------+------+
